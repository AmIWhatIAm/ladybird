// The event loop enables asynchronous (not parallel or multi-threaded) computing by efficiently handling events from various sources.
// Event loops are most important for GUI programs, where the various GUI updates and action callbacks run on the EventLoop,
// as well as services, where asynchronous remote procedure calls of multiple clients are handled.
// Event loops, through select(), allow programs to "go to sleep" for most of their runtime until some event happens.
// EventLoop is too expensive to use in realtime scenarios (read: audio) where even the time required by a single select() system call is too large and unpredictable.
//
// There is at most one running event loop per thread.
// Another event loop can be started while another event loop is already running; that new event loop will take over for the other event loop.
// This is mainly used in LibGUI, where each modal window stacks another event loop until it is closed.
// However, that means you need to be careful with storing the current event loop, as it might already be gone at the time of use.
// Event loops currently handle these kinds of events:
// - Deferred invocations caused by various objects. These are just a generic way of telling the EventLoop to run some function as soon as possible at a later point.
// - Timers, which repeatedly (or once after a delay) run a function on the EventLoop. Note that timers are not super accurate.
// - Filesystem notifications, i.e. whenever a file is read from, written to, etc.
// - POSIX signals, which allow the event loop to act as a signal handler and dispatch those signals in a more user-friendly way.
// - Fork events, because the child process event loop needs to clear its events and handlers.
// - Quit events, i.e. the event loop should exit.
// Any event that the event loop needs to wait on or needs to repeatedly handle is stored in a handle, e.g. s_timers.
